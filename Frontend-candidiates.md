## Important

You only need to make changes to the frontend application located in the `/ui` folder.

    You don't need to run the API at all!

## How to submit your work
- Create a new public GitHub repository (don't fork this!)
- Email us a link to the GitHub repository
- Include any notes you think are relevant
  - If time wasn't a constraint what else would you have done?
  - How was this test overall? I.e too hard, too easy, how long it took, etc

## How to run the application
- In new terminal - Go to */mock-api/* (starts up the mock api)
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`
- In new terminal - Go to */ui/* (starts up the UI)
  - `npm install`
  - `npm start`

## Requirements
1. Create a client
    - All fields are required
2. Edit a client
    - All fields are required
3. Search for a client
    - Searching in the "search field" should filter the list of clients by their first or last name
    - Example: John Stevens and Steven Smith should both show up if a user searches "steven"
    - Example: John Stevens should show up if a user searches "john"

### Extra points
1. Be as close to the design as possible
2. Can your submission scale to a larger project?
